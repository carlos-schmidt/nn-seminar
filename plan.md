# Plan for Presentation and Paper: Multi-modal Speech Representation Learning

0. How to use VSCode + Tex?
1. Read and understand papers.
2. Write down questions regarding papers and also highlight important stuff etc.
3. Ask said questions, also ask what exactly the paper and presentation should contain / not contain.

## Questions from Papers

[1] Mohamed, Abdelrahman, et al. "Self-supervised speech representation learning: A review." IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (2022).

[2] Ao, Junyi, et al. "Speecht5: Unified-modal encoder-decoder pre-training for spoken language processing." ACL (2022).

[3] Zhu, Qiushi, et al. "Vatlm: Visual-audio-text pre-training with unified masked prediction for speech representation learning." IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (2023).

[4] Shi, Bowen, et al. "Learning audio-visual speech representation by masked multimodal cluster prediction." ICLR (2022).

## What needs to be in the presentation

1. Motivation: Current state (is single mode current sota?), then show that multi modal data is easy to get (if it's true)
2. Gathering multi-modal data
3. Present approaches by papers
4. Present their results? Possibly better scores / more use cases
